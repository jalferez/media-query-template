# 📱 Responsive CSS Media Query Template

This repo is a simple starter template for **mobile-first responsive design** that has worked for me!
It includes common breakpoints for phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops.

⚠️ **Note:** Keep in mind this has only been tested with **vanilla static projects** (plain HTML + CSS).  
It should work fine in other environments, but adjustments may be needed.

## 📂 Structure
- `css/breakpoints.css` → Media query breakpoints
- `examples/index.html` → Demo usage 

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Copy `breakpoints.css` into your project.
2. Add your own styles inside each media query block.
3. Customize/remove breakpoints as needed.

## Example
```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
```
